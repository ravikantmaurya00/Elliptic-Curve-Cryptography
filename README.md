This repository contains whole knowledge about what is elliptic  curve cryptography and how it works.
# INTRODUCTION
Elliptic Curve Cryptography is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that employs the algebraic architecture of elliptic curves with finite fields.
The term "elliptic curve " is derived from the ellipse. Elliptic curves are discovered in the form of the Diophantine equation for c,after the 17th century.
This cryptography is an encryption technology comparable to RSA that enables the public key encryption.
RSA's security is dependent on huge prime numbers but ECC leverages the mathematical theory of elliptic curves to achieve the same level of security with considerably smaller keys .
Victor Miller and Neal Koblitz separately proposed elliptic curve ciphers in the mid 1980s.On a high level,they are analogs of actual public cryptosystems in which modular arthimetic is substituted by elliptic curve operations.
# Components  of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
# 1.ECC keys:
# (i).Private Key:
ECC cryptography's private key is as simple as safely producing a random integer in a specific range , making it highly quick.Any integer in the field represents a valid ECC private key.
# (ii).Public Key:
Public keys within ECC are EC points , which are pairs of integers coordinates x,and y that lie on a curve .
